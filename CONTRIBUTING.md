Bug reports, feature requests or code contributions are always very welcome.

To make things easier, here are a few tips:

Reporting bugs, requesting features
-----------------------------------

-   Best way to report bugs and request new features is to use GitHub
    [Issues](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/robot_controllers/issues), but you can contact the maintainers also any other way — see the [README](README.md) for details.

Code contribution
-----------------

-   Best way to contribute is using GitHub [Pull Requests](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/robot_controllers/pulls)
    — fork the repository and make a pull request from a feature branch. You can also send patches via e-mail or contact the maintainers in any other way — see the [README](README.md) for details.
-   Follow the project coding guidelines. In case of doubt, please contact the maintainers.
-   All your code will be released under the project license (see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details), so make sure you and your collaborators (or employers) have no problems with it.
